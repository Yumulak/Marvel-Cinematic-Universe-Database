Questions: 
1. How did the projects design evolve over time?
At first I thought I would just have a database of all of the MCU movies with information on them as columns, then I added the comic inspirations, writers, illustrators. Now I plan to make it more searchable with indexes and then add visualization, I would also like to eventually create a website using this database.

2. Did you choose to use an ORM or raw SQL? Why? 
ORM because I want to work more with Python

3. What future improvements are in store, if any?
I still need to add all of the comic stories inspirations, writers, and illustrators. 
I need to finish the flask app and API 
A visualization of the critics and viewer ratings over time or other metrics is something I will do
